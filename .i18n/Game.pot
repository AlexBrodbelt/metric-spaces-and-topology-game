msgid "# Transitioning to metric spaces\n"
"When proving many theorems about limits in real analysis,\n"
"the triangle inequality is the biggest ingredient.\n"
"In the theory of metric spaces, we will aim to generalise some of these concepts in real\n"
"analysis to things other than the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$\n"
"(such as $\mathbb{R}^2$ or even geometric shapes...).\n"
"When we make the jump to the wider setting, we will assume our space $X$\n"
"has an associated function $d \colon X \times X \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ where $d(x,y)$\n"
"will represent the 'distance' between\n"
"$x, y \in X$ (in place of how $|x-y|$ is used to measure distances in $\mathbb{R}$).\n"
"To behave like we expect distances should, our distance function $d$ must satisfy 2 conditions\n"
"which will be part of the metric space axioms:\n"
"- $d(x,y) = 0 \iff x=y$\n"
"- $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$\n"
"- $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$ *(the triangle inequality)*\n"

"# Task:\n"
"Now, to remind ourself about the power of the triangle inequality, let's show it's equivalent\n"
"to the reverse triangle inequality (another tool in real analysis) assuming very little about\n"
"what the absolute value of real numbers actually is."
